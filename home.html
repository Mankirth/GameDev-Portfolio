    <p class="title">Welcome!</p>
    <div class = "txt">I'm a game developer specializing in programming & designing since 2021. <br><br>
        Based in Ontario, Canada, I studied at York University where I was able to learn from industry professionals and create games with a wide range of people. <br><br>
        As a student, I was able to gain recognition in the field with my project No Escaping the Horde and I continue to strive for improvement with my first online multiplayer game Champ of the Zone.
        Whenever I have the opportunity to design, I build my games around the moments that players will remember. Focusing on the feelings I want my games to imbue and making sure every decision contributes to that vision.</div><br>

                    Champ of the Zone is an online 2D fighting game meant to give beginners in the genre access to higher 
                    level mindgames without needing to build executional skill. It is my first online game with Unity NGO and is made unique 
                    with its approach to characters and combat. Players create their chracter builds by assigning attacks to their 
                    binds, letting them find synergies and stacking benefits between attacks. Inspired by games such as YOMI Hustle, 
                    Footsies, & Divekick, combat is closer to fencing where rounds are decided in one hit to emphasize the importance 
                    of reading your opponent and setting up plays.

                It is built around a unique health mechanic where your health is always being drained and getting damaged makes it drain faster.
                After completing the project, it was accepted as the only solo-dev game into Toronto Games Week 2025's NextGen Showcase; a curated 
                exhibit of 10 student-made games.

                <p class="projectDisc">In January 2025, student-led club Game Devs @ YorkU ran a large-scale collaborative 
                    game project where approximately 60 students worked together to create a game over the course of a semester
                    before it was brought to 2025's Level-Up Showcase. I was brought onto the project to co-lead the game 
                    design team, mentoring 7 other students to help to define core mechanics and design levels for the game. 
                    This project served as an opportunity to work in a team much larger than those I would otherwise be able 
                    to work in while giving me exposure to leading and managing others. Working on the game also built my 
                    design skills, giving me an opportunity to practice and lead workshops on level/puzzle design.

                    research project in collaboration with researchers monitoring the penguins in southern Austrailia. I designed 
                    and built a web platform to serve as a specialized data analysis tool using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js, 
                    and a Leaflet map. To aid the researchers, the website is meant to help draw conclusions about the impact of 
                    the local climate on the penguin population on Phillip Island. Users can toggle between layers of climate or 
                    penguin population data and generate graphs displaying the relation between variables. The website is capable 
                    of displaying decades worth of climate data with layer customization and data upload at approximately 20,000 
                    datapoints/sec.

                    control. Many of these projects are short vertical slices made in teams of 4-6 also giving me the chance to build 
                    games across multiple genres. These games include dungeon crawlers, first person shooters, survival, party-fighting,
                    and even an experimental 'keepsake' game using a physical stamping component to compliment a choose-your-own-adventure
                    style game.

                    helped grow my proficiency with my tools. The dev time of these games range from less than a week to a few months but 
                    they were all made in an effort to quickly try something new. Some of these games include my first time making games 
                    with Godot, SQL Databases, and GBStudio. This collection also further explores some genres and concepts that I haden't tried 
                    before such as endless runners, turn-based combat systems, cooking games, and idle games.

                    Unity and C#, it is a speedrun focused platformer built around a character with a slingshot arm. The game challenges 
                    the player to learn levels and improve their execution until they can beat the level before time runs out.

                <p class="projectDisc">My second ever game, this was created in 2 weeks shortly after finishing Project Lockdown to test what I had learned. 
                    It is another speedrun focused platformer but I was able to experiment with ideas I couldn't fit into the 
                    previous project. You control a ball and use a physics-based rope to swing yourself around the levels as fast as 
                    possible. This game also takes a new approach to level design using a simple lock-and-key mechanic and moving away 
                    from the tiles used in Project Lockdown in favour of blocking out and drawing over the levels in larger pieces.
